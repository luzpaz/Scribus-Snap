# Unofficial Scribus Snap

This Snap package aims to only build the latest development version. The stable version at some point be supported as well.  
This snap is not affiliated with the Scribus team. Its objective is to make Scribus dev more available for use and testing, since Scribus development cycles are very long and many bugs and features are fixed in the development version.

When ready, the Snap package will be available from https://snapcraft.io/scribus-git
