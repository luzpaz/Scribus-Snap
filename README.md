# Unofficial Scribus Snap

This Snap package aims to only build the latest development version. The stable version at some point be supported as well.  
This snap is not affiliated with the Scribus team. Its objective is to make Scribus dev more available for use and testing, since Scribus development cycles are very long and many bugs and features are fixed in the development version.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Successfully create a working [snap/snapcraft.yaml](snap/snapcraft.yaml) â†’ **WIP** any help is appreciated https://github.com/luzpaz/Scribus-Snap/issues/1
- [ ] Ability to build test builds from patches (see the equivalent in the [FreeCAD Snap documentation](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-snap/blob/master/docs/index.md#build-snaps-from-freecad-branches-or-forks) https://github.com/luzpaz/Scribus-Snap/issues/2
